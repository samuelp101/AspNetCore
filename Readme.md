Note:  
This repo is work-in-progess documentation project for ASP.NET Core, EF-Core and related frameworks, to serve my own purpose.
Much of the contents in this repo are acquired from Microsoft documentation, books other developers in the community gracefully shared their knowledge, and I'm sharing them back with the community.

The contents are created based on the following version:
 - ASP.NET Core 3.1, 5.0 and 6.0

In general, project structure and coding syntax between ASP.NET Core 3.1 and 5.0 are identitcal.
The same project created in 3.1 should be able to function in 5.0 by simply updating the targeted Framework version and the project's included Nuget packages to the appropriate version.

Moving from 5.0 to 6.0, there are some changes to the project structure and syntax, along with some new features not supported in the earlier version.
However, the same structrue and syntax in 5.0 is supported in 6.0.
To upgrade 5.0 project to 6.0, you can simply update the project's targeted framework and update the project's included Nuget packages to the appropriate version.
